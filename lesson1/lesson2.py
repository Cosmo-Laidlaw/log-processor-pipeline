#1 Reading a Text File (Line by Line)
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:

lines = ["Hello", "World", "This is a test"]

with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")

data =[["name", "age"],["Alice", 30], ["Bob", 25]]

with open("people.csv", "w", newline = '') as f:
    writer = csv.writer(f)
    writer.writerows(data)

with open("config.json", "r") as f:
    config = json.load(f)
